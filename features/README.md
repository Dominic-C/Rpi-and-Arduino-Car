This repo contains arduino code that I'm currently testing for future upgrades to this project. My goals are to implement the following.

- encoder capability to the robot to get wheel velocity
- publishing odometry messages from the encoder data to integrate with ROS
- Migrate whole robot system to use ROS

## What I have done so far
Currently, I have semi completed implementations for the ROS platform. I'm able to conduct teleoperation on a robot chassis via ROS and have just managed to output wheel rotations from an encoder. This repository aims to be a holding place for all my arduino code related to my personal robotics projects.
